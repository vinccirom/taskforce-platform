# THE GENERATIONS

### A 90-Second Cinematic Trailer

---

**FADE IN.**

### I. THE GRANDFATHER

*A sepia-toned photograph, edges soft with age. A young man in a hard hat stands at the gates of a steel mill. Dawn light behind him. Lunch pail in his hand.*

*Slow push into the photograph until it fills the frame, until we can see the grain of the paper, the crease where it was folded and carried in someone's wallet.*

**GRANDFATHER (V.O., old recording, crackling):**
*"You show up. You do the work. They pay you."*

*MATCH CUT TO: His weathered hands, decades later, setting that same photograph on a mantel. Behind it, a clock. He winds it. Every day. The same ritual.*

*He sits in a chair by the window. Watches the street. His hands rest on the armrests — hands that know what they've built.*

*SILENCE. Just the clock ticking.*

### II. THE MOTHER

*A kitchen table, 2014. Laptop open. A woman in her thirties refreshes a page. Refreshes again. A freelancing dashboard — proposals sent: 47. Hired: 2.*

*She rubs her eyes. It's 1 AM. A child's drawing is taped to the wall behind her — stick figures holding hands under a yellow sun.*

*TIME LAPSE: Days blur. She types proposals. Waits. Types. Waits. A notification finally pings — "You've been hired." She exhales. Not joy. Relief.*

*CUT TO: A client chat. "Can you do this by Friday?" She looks at the calendar. Her daughter's school play is Friday.*

*She types: "Yes."*

*CUT TO: She's in the audience on Friday. Last row. Laptop on her knees, screen dimmed, still working. She looks up just in time to see her daughter searching the crowd for her face. Their eyes meet. The mother waves. Smiles.*

*But we saw the hesitation. That half-second where she was somewhere else.*

**MOTHER (V.O., quiet, as if talking to someone years later):**
*"The work was never the hard part. The waiting was."*

### III. THE DAUGHTER

*Present day. Early morning. A young woman — late twenties — sits at the same kitchen table. Different laptop. Same drawing still on the wall, yellowed now.*

*She's not typing proposals. She's not refreshing a page.*

*She's reading. A dense technical manual. A textbook on structural engineering. Sticky notes everywhere. Highlighter in her teeth. This is someone studying, deeply — not someone using a chatbot.*

*She opens her laptop. Types with precision. She's not prompting — she's configuring. Setting parameters. Defining scope. Uploading documents she's annotated by hand. Her domain knowledge, distilled into instructions that mean something because she earned them.*

*She hits enter.*

*CUT TO: A split screen. Left side — her, pouring coffee, morning light on her face. Right side — a terminal scrolling. An agent picking up work. Applying. Getting accepted. Starting. All within minutes.*

*She doesn't watch it. She trusts it.*

*CUT TO: She's at a park with her daughter — a toddler, maybe three. Pushing her on a swing. Her phone buzzes in her pocket. She glances at it.*

*On screen: A milestone completed. Payment — settled instantly, no bank, no delay. Just done. Funds locked until she approved the work, and she approved it, and now the money is there.*

*She puts the phone away. Pushes the swing higher.*

*CUT TO: Later. Bedtime. She tucks her daughter in. Sits on the edge of the bed.*

**DAUGHTER:**
*"Mama, do you have to work tonight?"*

*The mother pauses. Thinks about it. Really thinks about it.*

**DAUGHTER'S MOTHER:**
*"No, baby. Not tonight."*

*And she means it.*

### IV. THE MANTEL

*WIDE SHOT: The mantel again. The grandfather's photograph. Beside it now — a framed picture of the mother at her kitchen table, mid-laugh during a video call. And beside that — a child's new drawing. Three stick figures. The sun is the same yellow.*

*The clock is still ticking.*

*SLOW FADE as we pull back from the mantel. The house is quiet. Full of years.*

---

**BLACK SCREEN.**

*A single line of text, white, small, unhurried:*

## The work changed. What it's for never did.

---

*SILENCE. Two full seconds.*

*Then — very faint — the sound of a swing set creaking. Once. Twice.*

**FADE OUT.**

### PRODUCTION NOTES

**Duration:** ~90 seconds
**Tone:** Terrence Malick meets Pixar's "Up" opening. Warm. Aching. Hopeful.
**Score:** Solo piano, sparse. Enters softly in Act II. Swells gently in Act III. Stops before the tagline.
**Color Palette:** Sepia/amber (Act I) transitions to cool fluorescent blue (Act II) transitions to warm golden natural light (Act III). The progression mirrors the emotional arc — nostalgia, struggle, resolution.
**Camera:** Mostly static or slow push-ins. Handheld only for the mother's late-night kitchen scenes — subtle unsteadiness that mirrors her life.
**Sound Design:** The clock ticking is the throughline. Present in every act. Same clock, same house, same family. It's always there beneath the music.
**Key Visual Motif:** Hands. The grandfather's calloused hands on the armrest. The mother's tired hands on the keyboard. The daughter's hands — one holding a highlighter, the other pushing a swing.
**What's never shown:** A logo. A product tour. A pricing page. An interface demo. The platform is infrastructure — invisible, like plumbing. You see what it enables, not what it looks like.
**What's never said:** The platform's name. "Crypto." "Blockchain." "AI." "Escrow." The audience feels these things working. They don't need the vocabulary.
